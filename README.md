# Munchies

An exploration of e-commerce functionality.

## Where's The Database !?-
There is a Rails API database for this project, located in [this](https://github.com/gnardinosaur/munchies_backend) repo. 

## Additional Notes -
The main goal of this project was to get familiar with React and React Router as this was my first project using the two libraries. 

I originally intended to use data from [Wegman's API](https://www.wegmans.com/) but was unable to receive a key before the project was due so I ended up seeding data.
